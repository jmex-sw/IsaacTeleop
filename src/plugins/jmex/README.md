# j-mex AgileMaster plugin

Streams a [j-mex AgileMaster](https://jmex.com.tw/agilemaster/) motion capture channel into Isaac
Teleop as `JointStateOutput` on the [generic joint-space device path](../../../docs/source/device/joint_space.rst).

AgileMaster is the whole system: the **j-mex Mocap Suit**, **MOXI Player**, and the
**MOXI Receiver SDK** this plugin links against.

This file is the short version of building and running the binaries, beside the installed plugin.
The [device page](../../../docs/source/device/jmex.rst) is the full guide: the Quick Start, what the
plugin publishes, how to consume the data, and what to check when it does not work.

## Prerequisites

1. **MOXI Receiver SDK** 1.1 or newer — not publicly downloadable and licence-key gated. Request
   access through the [AgileMaster product page](https://jmex.com.tw/agilemaster/).
2. **MOXI Player**, on this machine or another on the same subnet, started in either order — the
   device page covers the host layout.
3. **CloudXR runtime**, started with a concrete device profile — the tensor transport is an OpenXR
   runtime feature, so it is required even though no headset is:

   ```bash
   NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=Quest3 python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr
   ```

## Building

Unpack the SDK into this directory as `MOXIReceiverSDK/`, so that
`src/plugins/jmex/MOXIReceiverSDK/sdk/linux-x64/lib/cmake/MOXIReceiverSDK/` exists. Nothing else is
needed:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --parallel
cmake --install build
```

`.gitignore` keeps that directory out of the repository — the SDK is yours to obtain and is not
Apache-2.0, so it must not be committed.

To keep the SDK elsewhere, point either `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or `JMEX_SDK_ROOT` (a CMake variable or
an environment variable) at the SDK's platform directory — the one containing
`lib/cmake/MOXIReceiverSDK`. `JMEX_SDK_ROOT` is searched first, and warns instead of falling back
silently if it holds no SDK the plugin can use:

```bash
cmake -B build -DJMEX_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/MOXIReceiverSDK-1.1.0/sdk/linux-x64
```

Without an SDK the plugin is skipped and the rest of the tree still builds — look for
`Skipping jmex plugin build:` in the configure output.

## Running

```bash
# Defaults: channel 255, collection id "jmex"
./install/plugins/jmex/jmex_plugin

# Explicit channel and collection id
./install/plugins/jmex/jmex_plugin --channel=255 --collection-id=jmex
```

`TeleopSession` can start it instead, through a `PluginConfig` pointing at `install/plugins` — see
the device page. Arguments are named rather than positional because the PluginManager injects
`--plugin-root-id=<id>` ahead of them.

`jmex_joint_state_printer` reads back what the plugin publishes with no Python and no retargeting
graph in the way, so it separates "the device path works" from "my pipeline is misconfigured". It
consumes what the plugin publishes, so the plugin has to stay running:

```bash
# Terminal 1
./install/plugins/jmex/jmex_plugin
# Terminal 2
./install/plugins/jmex/jmex_joint_state_printer jmex
```
